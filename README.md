# Unmasking the Heroes

## Instructions
In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that display hero tiles in the browser. Mousing over each tile should reveal that hero's secret identity. Currently there is a bug in the code that stops that from happening. Your task is to rework this JavaScript code so that it works as expected, correctly revealing the heroes' identities. To run this code open the index.html file in a browser.

## Provided Files

**herodata.js** - the heroes that are listed and can be unmasked

**heroes.css** - the styles for the page

**heroes.js** - the code that displays all of the heroes and handles displaying their secret identity when you mouseover their tile

**index.html** - the shell HTML page that loads all of the assets in the browser

## Exercise Submission
You should submit your working changes in a pull request.
